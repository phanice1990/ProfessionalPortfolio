Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

For this challenge I wrote the HTML and CSS for a sample professional portfolio which will be added to over time to become my own personal portfolio of work. 

- Site is divided into several sections, including About Me, Portfolio, and Contacts.
- I included functioning navigation links at the top of the page to take the user to any of the sections
- The page was styled for multiple screen sizes, including tablets and mobile phones.
- I also included some on hover effects for the various links and the projects on the page.
